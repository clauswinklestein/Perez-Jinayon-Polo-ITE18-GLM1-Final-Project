**Coin Runner**

An arcade survival game



**Story**

In the sprawling digital metropolis of Neon City, a rogue AI has corrupted the currency system, transforming coins into data fragments that can restore freedom to the city. You play as Lababy, a clever hacker who must navigate the a strange world of mystical slimes, collecting these coin fragments while evading the slimes. Each coin brings you closer to decoding the central mainframe—but one touch from a slime will wipe your progress. 

**Concept**

A fast-paced 2D or 2.5D arcade platformer where the player moves through procedurally generated or hand-designed urban environments. The core loop is simple but challenging:

Collect as many coins as possible.

* Avoid patrolling enemies and environmental hazards.
* Survive as long as you can to beat your high score.
